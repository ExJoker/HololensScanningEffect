This repository contains a Unity port of a shader that I developed for a real-time projection mapping on a PC. It turned out to be a bit heavy for running on the actual HoloLens device. It's not intended for commercial use.

A version that is optimized for running on the HoloLens is part of the HoloLens Shader Pack that is available for purchase in the Unity Asset Store https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/89989
